Understanding the degree of expertise in your readers decides the degree of complexity of language, concepts, and examples you use. To professionals in technology, you can use technical jargon and assume prior knowledge of ideas, while to non-professionals, you simplify, avoid technical jargon, and use analogies.

Strategies to adapt content include:

Adjusting language: Use jargon for professionals and simple language for non-professionals.
Depth of explanation: Provide detailed explanations to novices and focus on in-depth insights for professionals.
Use of examples: Comparable, real-life examples for beginners and profession-specific examples for experts.
Layered content: Provide introductory content with pointers to more material for someone who wants more information.
To discover existing knowledge, you can:
Ask pre-testing questions: If it is an interactive tutorial or class.
Use audience profiles: If one knows demographics or job titles.
Use two-way communication: Ask open-ended questions to check how well they understand concepts.
Employ feedback mechanisms: Like quizzes or requesting clarification.
Methods to make content more accessible:

Explain terms: Provide plain definitions or tooltips for jargon.
Employ analogies: Compare new technical ideas to familiar situations.
Unbundle steps: Break up complicated tasks into a sequence of easy steps.
Place in context: Explain why something is important before explaining how it works.
The use of simple language is called for because:

It enhances comprehension for more people.
It lowers the risk of misinterpretation.
It encourages involvement, as people are more likely to read and keep up.
It helps build trust by giving information in an open and accessible way.
Simplification examples of words:

"Start" vs. "Initiate": "Start the process" is easier to comprehend and more learnable than "initiate the process."
"Use" rather than "Utilize": "Use the tool" is a more natural and intuitive expression than "utilize the tool." Everyday words stay away from unnecessary complexity so that users are not bogged down with semantics but can simply get on with it.
Having examples and imagery makes abstract concepts easier to understand by:

Providing students with concrete references which bridge abstract thoughts.
Allowing students to be instructed in different modes (visual, verbal, kinesthetic).
Making them more memorable through linking to familiar notions or images.
Good visuals for delivering varying information:

Diagrams: Work best in showing how elements work together or systems process.
Charts/graphs: Ideal for use with data, trends, or comparisons.
Infographics: Work well for explaining key points and procedures in an attractive format.
Screenshots: Work well to show software or navigation through the interface.
Headings and subheadings improve readability by:

Creating an unambiguous structure and logical flow.
Allowing readers to browse the document for beneficial information at a glance.
Breaking content into manageable chunks that limit information overload.

Best practices for headings/subheadings:

Keep them concise yet informative.
Use consistent formatting and hierarchy (e.g., H1, H2, H3) to visually guide readers.
Make them descriptive of what the section is about.
Mirror the structure of the document for easier navigation.
In an intro to a Readme, use:

Brief summary of what the product does.
Key features or capabilities.
Target audience or use cases.
Easy step-by-step for beginners.
For brief summary of purpose and features:

Start with a one-sentence summary in clear language stating the overall purpose of the product.
Next, include bullet points listing major features or benefits.
Use active, plain language that resists oversimplification, e.g., "This tool creates reports automatically" instead of "This tool allows automation."
